               <h2>Yuzuru Hanyu makes figure skating history</h2>
               <div class="pText">
                 <p> Yuzuru Hanyu, born December 7, 1994, is a Japanese former competitive figure skater. He is the first men's singles skater to achieve a Super Slam, having won all major competitions in both his senior and junior careers.</p>
                <p> He has broken world records nineteen times. Upon winning his first Olympic title, he became the first Asian men's singles skater to win the Olympic gold. At nineteen years old, he was the youngest male skater to win the Olympic title since Dick Button in 1948. In 2018, he became the first man to win two consecutive Olympic gold medals since Button's back-to-back titles in 1948 and 1952. At the 2016 CS Autumn Classic International, Hanyu became the first skater in history to successfully land a quadruple loop in a competition. He is the first men's singles skater from Asia to win multiple World Championships.</p>
                <p> In recognition of his achievements, Hanyu became the youngest recipient of the People's Honour Award, bestowed by the Prime Minister of Japan for <i>"giving dreams and thrills to the people and hope and courage to society".</i></p>
                <p> On July 19, 2022, Hanyu announced his decision to turn professional and "step away" from competitive figure skating after a <strong>12-year</strong> senior career. The recent news of his retirement has been devastating, but he remains an inspiration to many.</p>
